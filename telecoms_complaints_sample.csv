Summary: Unexpected roaming charges after a short trip to Spain.

Details: I travelled to Barcelona from 15/01/2026 to 19/01/2026. Before travelling I called on 13/01 (call ref 887221) and explicitly asked about roaming rates, and was told that my 'International Lite' add-on would cover data and texts. My bill for January now contains a roaming charge of £34.17 for data on 17/01 and £12.50 for calls on 18/01. I have screenshots of the call notes from your agent (name given as Claire) and the on-screen confirmation message which said roaming included. I have already completed the online disputes form on 22/01 and spoken with your billing team twice (24/01 with Tom, ref BILL-445) who said they'd escalate, but there's been no resolution.

I am requesting a full reversal of the disputed roaming charges and a written explanation of why the add-on did not apply. This is frustrating and has taken too long; please respond within 14 days with a clear remediation plan.

I am writing to explain how your failure to provide accessible billing is causing ongoing stress. On 12/01/2026 I telephoned to request large-print bills and an option for bill explanation via telephone rather than online statements — the agent (Karen) said this would be added and gave me the case number ACC-889001.

This is not a dramatic emergency but it is important: I need accessible bills to manage my finances.

I am considering reporting this to the ICO and seeking legal advice if I do not receive a comprehensive response within 10 working days.

53,"Hello,

I am absolutely furious about a charge on my bill (ACC-614902, REF-20260210). On 10 February I was billed £17.99 for ""late network admin fee"" which was never mentioned when I upgraded in December. I called on 11/02 and spoke to Gareth who admitted it was ""possibly a system default"" and promised to reverse it. Yesterday 16/02 the charge still appeared — now with an extra £2.50 ""processing"" line. I can wait for corrections, I don't need immediate action, but I am appalled at the laziness here. I have been a customer since 2016; I upgraded on 02/12/2025 after being promised no hidden fees. Your advisors assured me I would only pay the plan rate and a one-off set up, which was done.

This is not about the money — it's about being misled and then ignored. Please remove the fee, refund the processing charge, and explain why your billing system keeps inventing fees. If I don't have confirmation within 7 working days I will consider escalating formally.

This is not a formal letter, just me as a customer utterly shaken by how a vulnerable customer's needs were ignored by your staff. Account ACC-447799 is in my mother's name (I am Tom Reynolds and act as her carer). She is registered as vulnerable with you since 2019 due to mobility and memory issues.

The representative, Paul, told me he couldn't find the vulnerability flag and bluntly said, ""We don't do carers"" — then put us on hold for 35 minutes and dropped the call. I had a panic attack after and had to cancel an appointment for the day because Mum was distraught.

I do not want the dramatic language of a regulator email; I want this fixed and for someone to accept responsibility. Please confirm the vulnerability flag has been reinstated, confirm the change to paper billing, and explain why your systems allowed this to be erased.

Account: ACC-881233. Reference: DD-ERR-20260212.

On 12/02/2026 my bank informed me an attempted direct debit of £240.00 was submitted twice on the same day, resulting in an unpaid charge and bank fees of £35.00. My normal monthly payment is £120.00. I have already contacted your billing line on 13/02 and was promised a refund for the extra attempt; this refund has not appeared. Please reverse the duplicate transaction, reimburse my bank fees, and confirm in writing that future direct debits will be processed correctly from my nominated account (sort code 40-12-34, acct ****1234). If this is not resolved within 48 hours I will pursue a formal chargeback and file a complaint with the Financial Ombudsman.

191,"Hello,

I’m absolutely delighted to see a £375 roaming charge on my bill for calls while visiting Portugal 03/02–06/02/2026 — delightful, because I certainly didn’t expect to have to remortgage to phone my family. My plan clearly states ‘EU roaming included’ and your website had no notification about new surcharges. I do appreciate surprises, but the only thing I enjoy less than unexpected bank charges is dealing with suspicion of billing incompetence. Please refund the £375, cancel any late/collection actions, and confirm you will credit my account. I expect a full explanation in writing.

202,"Dear Customer Support,

I am writing because your treatment of my 82‑year‑old mother, Mrs Joan Mercer (Account: JMR-551820), has been disgraceful and, frankly, dangerous. On 08/04 I called to report that her landline had been dead for two days and she could not call for help — she is on oxygen and would be unable to reach emergency services if there was a problem. I spoke with an advisor named Saira who told me she would mark the account as a priority and arrange an engineer for the 10/04. No engineer attended, no callback, and the line remained dead until 12/04 when I had to take her to A&E because she couldn’t contact anyone.

I have since called back four times (calls on 09/04, 11/04, 12/04 and 13/04) and been fobbed off or put on hold for an hour. Each time staff have treated the situation as an inconvenience rather than an emergency. This is wilful negligence towards a vulnerable customer. Your failure to provide a working emergency communication channel for someone reliant on it is unacceptable and puts lives at risk.

I require immediate escalation to the priority faults team, a written apology, and confirmation within 24 hours that protections will be applied to her account, plus details of the compensation you will provide for the harm and distress caused. If I do not hear back within 24 hours I will be contacting my local MP and Ofcom.

I need to tell the story of what your 'installation' has been. I placed an order on 05/03 for fibre to the property (Order FBN-20240305).
